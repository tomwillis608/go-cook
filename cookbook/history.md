# Go Cook! History

Many of the recipes and the title of this online cookbook come from a cookbook assembled by my mother
Gracia Willis around the time of my sister's first wedding. Typeset beautifully in $\LaTeX$ with cover art by Laura,
the print run was around one hundred.

This online version will contain some originals from the print version, sometimes contrasted with a contemporary take
on the same recipe, as well as other favorites of mine.

The original preface.

## Preface

"Go Cook!" is a family cookbook assembled for Tom
and Laura Willis. It contains historic family recipies from
great-grandmother Stock and her sisters. Many Willis, Stock
and Corbin relatives contributed their favorite recipies.
Our immediate family recipes cover the period of family favorites from
when Tom and Laura were growing up as well as today's choices.
Recipies from many friends have also been included.

The title "Go Cook!" is the phrase Tom, as a toddler,
used when he was very busy and wanted a parent to
leave him along.
