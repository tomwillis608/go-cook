## Ingredients (serves \~6)

* 5–6 medium Yukon Gold or red potatoes (about 2 lbs), peeled or scrubbed, cut into 1” cubes
* 4–5 slices bacon (≈½ lb), diced
* ½ cup finely diced onion
* 2 tbsp finely diced celery
* 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
* 3 tbsp sugar
* 1½ tsp salt
* 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
* 1½ tsp celery seed
* ⅓ cup white or apple cider vinegar
* ⅓ cup water (or use some potato cooking liquid for extra flavor)

### **Instructions**

1. **Cook the potatoes**

   * Place potato cubes in a pot of salted water.
   * Bring to a boil, simmer 10–12 minutes until just tender but not falling apart. Drain and set aside.

2. **Cook the bacon & aromatics**

   * In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until crisp. Remove bacon pieces and set aside, leaving the rendered fat in the pan.
   * Add onions (and celery if using) to the fat. Sauté 3–4 minutes until softened and translucent.

3. **Make the light roux-style sauce**

   * Sprinkle flour over the bacon fat \+ onions. Stir constantly for 1 minute to cook out the raw taste (this is the light roux).
   * Add sugar, salt, pepper, and celery seed. Stir.
   * Gradually whisk in vinegar \+ water until smooth. Heat gently, stirring, until sauce is slightly thickened but still pourable. **Don’t over-thicken** — it should lightly coat the potatoes.

4. **Combine with potatoes & bacon**

   * Add cooked potatoes and reserved bacon to the sauce. Gently fold to coat evenly.
   * Taste and adjust seasoning (vinegar or sugar) as desired.

5. **Serve**

   * Traditional: Serve **warm** directly from the skillet.
   * Cold: Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate — the sauce sets lightly but still clings to the potatoes.

### Notes / Historical Context

* **Light roux:** 2 tbsp flour in ½ cup fat \+ onions is enough to create a silky sauce without heaviness — typical of **Milwaukee/St. Louis deli variations**.
* **Sugar \+ vinegar balance:** Medium sweet-tang is consistent with Kohl’s and other Midwestern German-American versions.
* **Optional celery:** Some vintage community cookbooks from Milwaukee include it; you can omit if you prefer.
