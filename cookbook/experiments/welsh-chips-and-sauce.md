# **Pub-Style Welsh Crisps (Oven-Baked)**

--8<-- "kitchen-mode.md"

--8<-- "experimental.md"

These are hand-cut pub crisps, thin like American potato chips but cooked in a way that allows occasional sticking and unevenness. Crisp edges, tender centers. Rustic by design.

## **Ingredients**

* 1½ lb Yukon Gold or red potatoes
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* ¾ tsp kosher salt
* Freshly ground black pepper

## **Preparation**

1. Heat oven to **425°F (220°C)**.
2. Slice potatoes **1.5–2 mm thick** using a mandoline or slicer. Leave skins on.
3. Optional: soak slices in cold water **10 minutes max**. Drain and dry thoroughly.
4. Toss slices gently with olive oil and salt.

## **Cooking**

1. Line a baking sheet with parchment.
2. Arrange potato slices in a mostly single layer. Overlap is acceptable.
3. Bake **15 minutes**.
4. Flip gently, keeping any fused slices intact.
5. Bake another **10–15 minutes**, until deeply golden and crisp at the edges.

## **Finish & Serve**

* Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.
* Serve hot, alongside Welsh rarebit or as a base for dipping.

## **Welsh Rarebit (Mustard-Forward, Traditional)**

This is a **proper rarebit**: sharp, savory, mustard-led, and restrained. No beer foaminess, no spice heat, no cheese overload. Designed to sit comfortably with crisps or toast.

## Sauce Ingredients

* 1 tbsp butter
* 1 tbsp all-purpose flour
* ½ cup milk
* ¾ cup sharp white cheddar, finely grated
* 1½ tsp Dijon mustard
* ½ tsp dry mustard powder
* 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* Black pepper, to taste
* 1 tsp malt vinegar or lemon juice

## Sauce Preparation

1. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.
2. Whisk in flour and cook **1–2 minutes**, just until lightly blond.
3. Gradually whisk in milk until smooth.
4. Cook gently until slightly thickened.

## **Finish the Sauce**

1. Reduce heat to low.
2. Stir in Dijon, dry mustard, Worcestershire, and pepper.
3. Add cheese in small handfuls, stirring just until melted.
4. Taste and adjust with a few drops of vinegar if needed.

Do not boil.

## **Serve**

* Spoon over toasted bread and broil briefly **until lightly blistered**, or
* Serve warm as a dip alongside pub crisps.

## **Notes**

* The mustard should be noticeable but not aggressive.
* The sauce should be pourable, not spoon-stiff.
* This rarebit is savory, not creamy-sweet.

If you insist on deep frying, use a neutral oil (peanut, canola, or sunflower) with a high smoke point.
Not olive oil.

Preparation as above
Remember, drain and dry very thoroughly with towels:
moisture is the enemy of crispness and safety.

Frying

* Heat oil to 350°F (175°C).
* Fry potatoes in small batches. Do not overcrowd. Allow some slices to touch and overlap.
* Fry 2–3 minutes, stirring gently once or twice, until:
  * Edges are golden
  * Centers are set but not brittle

Draining & Seasoning

Remove crisps with a spider or slotted spoon.
Drain briefly on a rack or paper towels.
Season immediately with salt and black pepper.
