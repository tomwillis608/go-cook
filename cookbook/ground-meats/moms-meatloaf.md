This is the meatloaf of my childhood. Like any good meatloaf recipe, leftovers are great
for sandwiches the next day.

## Chef's Notes

!!! note "My Take"

I don't think I have ever cooked this recipe with the small amounts of
spices called for: I always use a lot more. Also, I never have celery salt
or garlic salt, so I use celery seed and garlic powder when I cook this.

My kids don't seem to go for the tucked eggs, but if you want that authentic
Sixties style, the eggs and ketchup bring it on.
