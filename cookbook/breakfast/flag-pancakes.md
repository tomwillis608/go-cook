These are the flaggiest pancakes you will ever make. The secret is letting the batter rest! Better with blueberry stars.
Originally a breakfast for patriotic occasions like Independence Day, Flag Day, and Memorial Day.

## Ingredients

- [x] 3 eggs
- [x] 1 &frac12; cups milk
- [x] 1 tablespoon corn or neutral oil
- [x] 2 cups Bisquick baking mix
- [x] red and blue food coloring
- [x] optional blueberries

## Instructions

- Mix Wet Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk the milk and eggs.
- Slowly add the Bisquick while stirring. Add extra milk by the spoonful if the batter is too thick.
- Pour a third of the batter into each of two additional bowls.
- Color one bowl with blue coloring and one with red.

!!! warning "Don't Overmix!"

- Stir until just combined. Lumps are okay! Overmixing makes them tough.
- Rest: Let the batter sit for 5-10 minutes. You should see bubbles forming.
- Cook: Heat a skillet over medium heat. Grease with oil. An electric skillet works well.
- For each pancake, pour the blue field as a rectangle, straightening edges with the spatula as needed. Add optional blueberries as stars.
- Pour red and white stripes to complete the flag.
- As soon as bubbles burst in the margins of the pancake, flip to finish. You may need two spatulas.

## Chef's Notes

!!! note "More fun"

"For additional food fun, pour a shape with one batter and add contrasting dots, stripes, and shapes to the pancake, or
around it or fused to it. Make favorite animals, the initials of guests, trains, planes, and automobiles." - Jim Willis
