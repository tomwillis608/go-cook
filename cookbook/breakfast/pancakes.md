## Ingredients

- [x] 2 cups all-purpose flour
- [x] 2 tbsp sugar
- [x] 1 tsp baking powder
- [x] 1/2 tsp baking soda
- [x] 2 cups buttermilk
- [x] 2 large eggs
- [x] 3 tbsp melted butter

## Instructions

- Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda.
- Mix Wet Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk the buttermilk and eggs. Slowly drizzle in the melted butter while whisking.
- Combine: Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture.

!!! warning "Don't Overmix!"

- Stir until just combined. Lumps are okay! Overmixing makes them tough.
- Rest: Let the batter sit for 10 minutes. You should see bubbles forming.
- Cook: Heat a skillet over medium heat. Grease with butter. Pour 1/3 cup of batter for each pancake. Flip when bubbles pop on the surface.

## Chef's Notes

!!! note "Substitutions"

If you don't have buttermilk, mix 2 cups of milk with 2 tbsp of vinegar and let it sit for 5 minutes.
