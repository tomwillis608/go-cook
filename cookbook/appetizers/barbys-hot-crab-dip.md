## Chef's Notes

!!! note "Source"

I think Barby was a college friend of Mom's.

!!! note "My Take"

You can take the flavor and kick of this tasty dip up a notch by doubling or tripling the horseradish,
onion, and using fresh cracked black pepper. Shake in some crushed red pepper flakes and a little Old Bay
for some extra heat.
