## Chef's Notes

!!! note "My Take"

I always increase the Worcestershire in almost all the old family
recipes and this is no exception. Also, a dash of Tabasco? Hah.
Consider substituting Crystal, Louisiana, or Franks for Tabasco, and shake it in there.
Also, I do not recall the last time I used margarine, so use butter.
For an extra step, add some Old Bay spice powder in the first step.
