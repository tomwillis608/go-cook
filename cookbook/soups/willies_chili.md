This is the chili of my childhood, often prepared by my dad.
This is a vastly scaled-down version of a VA Hospital recipe
that fed 1100 people at a time.

## Ingredients

- [x] 2 pounds ground beef
- [x] 2 medium yellow onions, peeled and sliced
- [x] 2 or 3 teaspoons chili powder
- [x] 2 one pound cans of chili beans (use 15oz cans)
- [x] 2 one pound cans of kidney beans (use 15oz cans), rinsed
- [x] 2 28 ounce cans of stewed whole tomatoes or equivalent fresh tomatoes, including green tomatoes

## Instructions

- Brown the ground beef in a stew pot in the presence of the chili powder.
- Add the onions and cook until tender.
- Add the kidney beans and chili beans.
- Add the tomatoes.
- Fill both chili bean cans with water and add to the pot. If desired, add more water.
- Simmer, stirring, for at least 2 hours.
- Serve with corn bread.

- Add the beaten egg, spices, and Worcestershire sauce.
- Shape into a load, in a loaf pan.
- If desired, hide the peeled hard cooked eggs in the center of the loaf.
- Spread ketchup over the top of the loaf.
- Bake for 1 hour.

## Chef's Notes

!!! note "My Take"

I often take this recipe in other directions, but it is a solid Midwestern
chili that just works. Even better the next day.

!!! note "Source"

My grandfather Henry Willis would make chili for the masses when he
was a cook at the VA hospital in Knoxville, Iowa. He taught this recipe
my dad Jim in 1953 so he would know how to cook something when he got to college.
